2014, October 22nd
- options improvement 
- better printing of sat diagnosis

2014, October 6th
- clean the options and add a verbosity level

2014, October 1st
- add a weak test for well-formedness of acyclic list
  segments and special test for dll segments.
- change of status for some benchmarks in dll.

2014, September 29th
- add options to trigger different optimisations of the
  decision procedure.

2014, July 25th
- new version of the algorithm for translating general
  predicate definitions to tree automata

2014, July 23rd
- deal with nested loops in predicate matrix by translating it
  into an predicate edge in the matrix graph.

2014, July 15th
- generate correct labels for the nodes of trees generated
  from nested calls of predicates in TA.

2014, July 4th
- new algorithm for general predicate definitions,
  where the formula with two unfoldings of the matrix is 
  used to build the tree automaton.

2014, June 29th
- first version of the refactoring of graph2ta: from
  graph is built a tree (see noll_tree.*) and then a TA


2014, June 26th
- start implementing the general translation of predicate
  definitions into the Tree Automata in noll_pred2ta_gen.c; 
  this version only builds the tree of the predicate matrix 
  based on the existing code.
- require some refactoring of graph2ta in order to reuse
  the marking and tree building.

2014, June 16th
- found bug in noll2sat and noll2bool in the encoding of
  the transitivity for = relation, all examples pass now

2014, June 13th
- fix parsing of predicates to avoid distinct 
  between first arg and args of different types
- allow empty negative formulas to obtain sat problems
- make norm_incr to stop as soons as the formula is unsat
- fix memory deallocation problem for fsat
- 0 errors in sll0a_sat
- add to the boolean abstraction two clauses for det_pto_pto
  in order to infer difference relation between x and z in 
  ls(x,y)* y->u * z->v 
  5 errors in sll0a_entl


2014, June 12th
- write test for select_wellformedness (only cond 2)
- add partial treatment of dll in wellformedness
- fixed lecture of minisat result on linux
- fixed bug for emp formula in RHS
- 14 errors in sll0a_entl
- 55 errors in sll0a_sat

2014, June 11th
- indentation of sources done without tabs
- emp formulas generate empty graphs
- pass sll0a_entl benchmark revealed problem in select
- 181 errors in sll0a_entl

2014, June 10th
- checkings of predicate definitions aligned to paper
- dll definition base case accepted
- emp space formula introduced
